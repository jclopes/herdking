herdking
========

Herding game for iphone. The player controls a herding dog that need to push the sheep into the barn.

Required libs:
 - cocos2d: http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org
 - chipmunk: http://chipmunk-physics.net

This project was my attempt to develop a game by my self from the concept to the final code.
I wanted the game to be played by small childdren (even babies) but make it chalanging to adults. This required the game to have extremelly minimalistic user interface and a very clear feedback of the progress.
